## Randomized Algorithms â€“ Universal Hashing for O(1) Search

This project explores **universal hashing** as a randomized algorithm to achieve **expected constant-time `O(1)` search**.  
It combines **theory**, **mathematical proof**, and **implementation** to show how universal hashing outperforms traditional search algorithms like **binary search**, **binary search trees (BST)**, and **red-black trees**.

### ðŸ“– Overview
Efficient searching is critical in computer science.  
While:
- **Binary Search** provides `O(log n)` performance (on sorted data),
- **Balanced Trees** (like Red-Black Trees) maintain `O(log n)` operations,  

**Universal Hashing** uses randomization to reduce collisions and achieve **expected `O(1)`** search time.

This project covers:
- **Why universal hashing is needed**  
- **Mathematical proof** of its constant-time expected search  
- **Implementation** for integer datasets  
- **Graphical performance comparison** with other search methods

### ðŸ”¬ Theory in Brief

A family of hash functions $\mathcal{H}$ is **universal** if for any two distinct keys $\( x \neq y \)$:  

$\[
\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}
\]$

where $\( m \)$ is the table size.  

This property ensures **low collision probability**, making the **expected search time**:  

$\[
\mathbb{E}[T_{search}] = O(1)
\]$
